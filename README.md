# Geometric-Mixture-Classifier
The Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC) tackles multi-modal classes by detecting sub-clusters, learning local linear boundaries, and uniting them into a single decision region. This geometric approach avoids complex assumptions, offering interpretability, strong performance, and proof-of-concept validation.
